This is my breakable toy. It is not intended to be useful at all.

Compiling:

To compile, download NInject and add NInject.dll to the lib/ folder. If you'll want to run the unit tests, you will need nunit.framework.dll and SpecUnit.dll in the lib/ folder also. Make sure that the nunit dll is of the same version as the one used to compile SpecUnit.

$ make all
