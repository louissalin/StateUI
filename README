This is my breakable toy. It is not intended to be useful at all.

Compiling:

To compile, download NInject and add NInject.dll to the lib/ folder. If you'll want to run the unit tests, you will need nunit.framework.dll and SpecUnit.dll in the lib/ folder also. Make sure that the nunit dll is of the same version as the one used to compile SpecUnit.

If you are on Windows, edit the Makefile and change the variable CSC to point to your C# compiler of choice.

$ make

This will make the libraries, but won't compile the tests.

$ make all

This will compile the libraries and the unit tests.
